### Background Info
Instagram is a social media platform where users can share photos and videos, and can be either viewed publicly or privately. The app allows users to have a following, and uses likes, tags, and hashtags at the users disposal. The home page is a feed for the user to scroll through their followings, looking at other users' posts, stories, and updates. 

### Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation - [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released

### Heuristic Evaluation
Overall Evaluation:
The platform is a nice way for family members to check up on each others life updates, but isn't necessarily fit for the daily/random parts of the day updates. Once users start following more people, it might get difficult to check up on family members, as they would get lost in the sea of their followings. It's hard to separate family members into their own grouping using this.
