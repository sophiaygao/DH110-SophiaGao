#Background Info
Instagram is a social media platform where users can share photos and videos, and can be either viewed publicly or privately. The app allows users to have a following, and uses likes, tags, and hashtags at the users disposal. The home page is a feed for the user to scroll through their followings, looking at other users' posts, stories, and updates.
