# Assignment 01-Heuristic Evaluation
## Sophia Gao - DH 110 Spring 2023

## Tentative Title: FindMyFamily

I want to create a platform for family members to be able to see daily updates and pictures from wherever they are located. It is similar to FindMyFriends, but when you click on the family member, any posts they made that day/at that location will show up too. The postings will stay at the location they are uploaded from, and so this way you can see if anyone is traveling or not. Users will be able to comment and react to each post as well. 

### Competitor A: Instagram

### Background Info
Instagram is a social media platform where users can share photos and videos, and can be either viewed publicly or privately. The app allows users to have a following, and uses likes, tags, and hashtags at the users disposal. The home page is a feed for the user to scroll through their followings, looking at other users' posts, stories, and updates. 

### Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation - [Nielson Norman Group](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-rate-the-severity-of-usability-problems/)
0 = I don't agree that this is a usability problem at all
1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project
2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority
3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority
4 = Usability catastrophe: imperative to fix this before product can be released

### Heuristic Evaluation
Overall Evaluation:
The platform is a nice way for family members to check up on each others life updates, but isn't necessarily fit for the daily/random parts of the day updates. Once users start following more people, it might get difficult to check up on family members, as they would get lost in the sea of their followings. It's hard to separate family members into their own grouping using this. 


#### 1. Visibility of System Status
The application allows the user to know if they are logged in or not, in order to view their feed. I think it's a decent execution, as the users home feed will be dependent on if they have logged into their account or not. I would say it could be a tad bit clearer, because I know sometimes Instagram allows you to view a random feed if you don't follow specific people.
Severity: 2

#### 2. Match Between System & Real World
It uses clear and concise language that is easy to navigate through without a problem. The only language that the user could potentially have issues with is the captions other users decide to write, which is something that is out of control.
Severity: 0

#### 3. User Control and Freedom
Allows users to undo, edit, archive and delete posts, stories, comments on their own. It won't allow users to redo their undos though, which could be a problem if users delete something by mistake. In that case, they wouldn't be able to get their post back. 
Severity: 2

#### 4. Consistency and Standards
Follows platform and industry conventions- it has 5 main pages to navigate throughout which are clearly marked: Home, Search, Add (a post), Reels, and Profile. I feel this is the most standard formatting for social media platforms, which of most include search/explore pages, home, and a profile page. Users who use all types of apps would be able to navigate through this easily as well, though reels is something specific to Instagram.
Severity: 1

#### 5. Error Prevention
Allows me to confirm if I want to delete or save as a draft, if I'm exiting the Create Post page. This prevents any accidental deletions in the case I did want to save my post as a draft. The same goes for stories. 
Severity: 0

#### 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall
The subpages are very clearly labeled, which is easy for the user to remember and navigate to. 
Severity: 1

#### 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
Not many options for shortcuts in the platform, which is something that should be looked into. Users would have to go through every step along the process to their end goals.
Severity: 3

#### 8. Aesthetic and Minimalistic Design
Website only has 2 base colors: black and white, which is good since the users' posts will contain different colors. It also only uses 1 font, and looks like only 2 different font sizes. Buttons are made clear, as they are highlighted with a different color contained in a shape. Phone app design is better compared to the website though.
Severity: 1

#### 9. Help Users with Errors
Not many instances in which users would encounter an error message, only if there's network issues. 
Severity: 0

#### 10. Help and Documentation
There is a help tab when navigated from the users Profile page. There listed are a bunch of resources for the user to report any issues encountered, as well as a separate tab to report any problems. There are plenty of subpages suppporting each of these as well too, I think Instagram provides a good amount of resources to help the users.
Severity: 0
