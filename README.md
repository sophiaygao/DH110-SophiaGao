## Project

**##### I'm planning on working on a project that will allow families to connect across distances and different time zones. I'm currently thinking of combining components of BeReal and FindMyFriends, where you are able to see what each member is doing at different locations across the world at different times. You would be able to interact with each post as well, and it would only be visible to members of that certain family group chat.
